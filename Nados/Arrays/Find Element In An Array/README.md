- You are given a number n, representing the size of array a. 
- You are given n distinct numbers, representing elements of array a. 
- You are given another number d. 
- You are required to check if d number exists in the array a and at what index (0 based). If found print the index, otherwise print -1. 

## Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^7
-10^9 <= n1, n2 
.. n elements <= 10^9
-10^9 <= d <= 10^9

## Format

n2
.. n number of elements
A number d
