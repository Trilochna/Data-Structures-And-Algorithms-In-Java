- You are given a number n1, representing the size of array a1.
- You are given n1 numbers, representing elements of array a1.
- You are given a number n2, representing the size of array a2.
- You are given n2 numbers, representing elements of array a2.
- The two arrays represent digits of two numbers.
- You are required to find the difference of two numbers represented by two arrays and print the arrays. a2 - a1

Assumption - number represented by a2 is greater.

Constraints
1 <= n1, n2 <= 100
0 <= a1[i], a2[i] < 10
number reresented by a1 is smaller than number represented by a2

Format
Input
A number n1
n1 number of elements line separated
A number n2
n2 number of elements line separated

Output
A number representing difference of two numbers (a2 - a1), represented by two arrays.
