Sure! Let's go through each element and line of the provided code:

1. `class Solution`: This line defines a class named "Solution" which contains the logic for grouping anagrams.

2. `public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {`: This line defines a public method named "groupAnagrams" that takes an array of strings (`strs`) as input and returns a list of lists of strings. This method is responsible for grouping anagrams.

3. `Map<String, List<String>> result = new HashMap<>();`: This line declares a variable named "result" of type `Map` with a key of type `String` and value of type `List<String>`. It initializes the variable as a new instance of `HashMap`, which will be used to store the grouped anagrams.

4. `for(String s : strs) {`: This line starts a loop that iterates over each string (`s`) in the input array `strs`.

5. `char[] charArr = s.toCharArray();`: This line converts the current string `s` into a character array using the `toCharArray()` method. This will allow sorting the characters later.

6. `Arrays.sort(charArr);`: This line sorts the characters in the `charArr` array in ascending order using the `sort()` method from the `Arrays` class. This step ensures that anagrams will have the same sorted representation.

7. `String sortedString = String.valueOf(charArr);`: This line creates a new string (`sortedString`) by converting the sorted character array `charArr` back to a string using the `valueOf()` method from the `String` class.

8. `if(!result.containsKey(sortedString)) {`: This line checks if the `result` map does not contain the `sortedString` as a key.

9. `result.put(sortedString, new ArrayList<>());`: This line adds a new entry to the `result` map with the `sortedString` as the key and a new empty `ArrayList` as the value. This will be used to store the anagrams of the same group.

10. `result.get(sortedString).add(s);`: This line retrieves the list associated with the `sortedString` key from the `result` map and adds the current string `s` to that list. This effectively groups anagrams together.

11. `return new ArrayList<>(result.values());`: This line creates a new `ArrayList` by passing the collection of values from the `result` map to its constructor. This converts the values (which are lists of anagrams) into a flat list of lists, representing the grouped anagrams. This list is then returned as the final result.

That's a breakdown of each element and line of the given code. Let me know if you have any further questions!
