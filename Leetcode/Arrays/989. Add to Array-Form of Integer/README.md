# [989. Add to Array-Form of Integer[Easy]](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-to-array-form-of-integer/)

The array-form of an integer num is an array representing its digits in left to right order. For example, for num = 1321, the array form is [1,3,2,1]. Given num, the array-form of an integer, and an integer k, return the array-form of the integer num + k.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= num.length <= 104
- 0 <= num[i] <= 9
- num does not contain any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
- 1 <= k <= 104
