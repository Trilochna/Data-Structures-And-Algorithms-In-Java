# [Implement Queue using array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-queue-using-array/1?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=bottom_sticky_on_article)

Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)

Your Task :
You are required to complete the two methods push() which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the queue and pop() which returns a integer poped out from othe queue. If the queue is empty, it should return -1 on a pop operation. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1) for both push() and pop().
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) for both push() and pop().

Constraints:
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ x ≤ 105
