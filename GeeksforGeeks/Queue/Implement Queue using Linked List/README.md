# [Implement Queue using Linked List](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-queue-using-linked-list/1)

Implement a Queue using Linked List. 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the poped element)

Example 1:

Your Task:
Complete the function push() which takes an integer as input parameter and pop() which will remove and return an element(-1 if queue is empty).

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100
